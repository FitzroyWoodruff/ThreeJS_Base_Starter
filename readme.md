# ThreeJS_Base_Starter

## Based on Bruno Simon's Three.js old Starter

(the new one gives me issues with webpack-cli and 'internal-ip')

## Assets go in the 'static' directory (found that out the hardway)

Included are a few matcaps that I obtained online.

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at {your machines ip address}:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
